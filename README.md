# lifecycle
A Unity project for my bachelor thesis. Developed for the Valve Index, it's a scene in which you can watch and interact with the lifecycle of a butterfly.
To play it, you must have SteamVR installed and a VR Headset connected. As the build folder was to large to upload, you will have to build it again in Unity if you want to try it out.
